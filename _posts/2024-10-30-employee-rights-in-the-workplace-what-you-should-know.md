## 1. Right to Fair Compensation

### Minimum Wage and Overtime
Employees have the right to receive at least the federal minimum wage and, in many cases, state minimum wage laws. Additionally, if you work more than 40 hours in a week, you are entitled to overtime pay, which is typically 1.5 times your regular hourly rate.

### Pay Transparency
Many states have enacted laws requiring employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings. This promotes pay equity and helps employees negotiate fair compensation.

## 2. Right to a Safe Working Environment

### Occupational Safety and Health
Employees are entitled to work in environments free from serious hazards. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets and enforces standards to ensure workplace safety.

### Reporting Unsafe Conditions
If you encounter unsafe working conditions, you have the right to report them without fear of retaliation. Employers are obligated to address safety concerns and protect their employees.

## 3. Right to Non-Discrimination

### Equal Treatment
Employees are protected from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. Federal laws, such as the Civil Rights Act, enforce these rights.

### Harassment-Free Workplace
Employees also have the right to work in an environment free from harassment. This includes sexual harassment, which is a violation of federal law. It’s essential to report any instances of harassment to your employer or human resources department.

## 4. Right to Privacy

### Personal Belongings
Employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding personal belongings at work. Employers should have clear policies regarding searches of personal items.

### Electronic Communication
While employers can monitor company-owned devices and networks, they must inform employees about any monitoring practices. It’s important to review your company’s policies on electronic communication.

## 5. Right to Family and Medical Leave

### FMLA Benefits
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for specific family and medical reasons without the fear of losing their job. This includes caring for a newborn or addressing serious health issues.

### Employer Responsibilities
Employers must inform employees of their rights under the FMLA and cannot retaliate against those who exercise their rights to take leave.
