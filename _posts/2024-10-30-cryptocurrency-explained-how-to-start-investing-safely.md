## What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security.

This means transactions are recorded across multiple computers, making it nearly impossible to alter or hack.

### Key Features of Cryptocurrency

- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls cryptocurrencies, which can lead to increased privacy and freedom.
- **Anonymity**: Users can make transactions without revealing their identities.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which is public and accessible.
